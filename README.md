## UX Notes:

- User/Stakeholder Questions:

	- Ask questions that give a broad idea of the product, then ask more in-depth questions that outline more specific aspects, then ask questions that give you a background of them and their persona, and their desired audience's persona.


- Gut Test

	- Get lots of examples from different didgital products and ask the client to rate each example from 1 - 5; 1 meaning terrible and 5 meaning brilliant.

	- Get a collection of at least 5 final designs / products that were rated 4+ to get a good idea of what the client desires.


- Relevant Implications

	- Explain how your desgin addresses issues and problems, eg: legal, social, privacy, accessibility, future-proofing.


- User Experience Study

	- Investigate the users and their persona when faced with certain problems.

	- Understand how they react and their thinking patterns.


- Feedback

	- Ask the client about the issues and don't suggest a solution. Getting the client's pure and uninfluenced point of view is cruicial to tailoring the design to their wants and needs. 

	- Make sure that the desgin you give them is up to a standard where it can be tested / reviewed efficiently with sufficient.


- Competitive Analysis

	- Check when similar companies / products are doing and see what works for them and what doesn't work. 

	- Also excelling past their standards and building your own.


- Card Sorting

	- Create cards (digital or physical) with different aspects and functions of your desgin / product. 

	- Have groups groups setup groups and have the client and other testers organize the cards into where they think they should go / what the fit under. 

	- Make sure the cards are shuffled and they do not contain a pattern that could change the mind of your testers.


- User Persona

	- A collection of information about a person, eg: name, age, location, education, relationship, hobbies, likes / dislikes, etc.

	- Use this to tailor the website to a group of people with similar personas.


- Empathy Map

	- Get a list of feelings and thoughts from the testers and find patterns and common ideas between similar personas.


- Journey Map

	- Create a map of the changes you make and the feedback you receive.


- Site map

	- Create a map of where different buttons and pages / scenes go to for an easy way to see the overall .


- Low Fidelity

	- A very simple mockup of what the design could look like to get feedback from the client that can easily be applied.


- High Fidelity

	- A higher quality layout mockup with more detail.

	- A full mockup of what the product will look like to show the client to get accurate feedback on.


- Build and Test

	- Create a minimal working version of the see if the interaction between the user and the product is as desired of the client.

	- Add or remove any features the client wants.
