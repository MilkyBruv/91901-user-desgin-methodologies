## UX Notes

- User Experience Study

	- Investigate the users and their persona when faced with certain problems.

	- Understand how they react and their thinking patterns.

	- "Put yourself in their shoes".

	- Understand what they want and solely what *they* want, do not influence their choices and decisions with your own ideas and solutions and thoughts. 


- User/Stakeholder Questions:

	- Ask questions that give a broad idea of the product, then ask more in-depth questions that outline more specific aspects, then ask questions that give you a background of them and their persona, and their desired audience's persona.


- Gut Test

	- Get lots of examples from different didgital products and ask the client to rate each example from 1 - 5; 1 meaning terrible and 5 meaning brilliant.

	- Get a collection of at least 5 final designs / products that were rated 4+ to get a good idea of what the client desires.


- Relevant Implications

	- Explain how your desgin addresses issues and problems, eg: legal, social, privacy, accessibility, future-proofing.


- Feedback

	- Ask the client about the issues and don't suggest a solution. Getting the client's pure and uninfluenced point of view is cruicial to tailoring the design to their wants and needs. 

	- Make sure that the desgin you give them is up to a standard where it can be tested / reviewed efficiently with sufficient.


- Competitive Analysis

	- Check when similar companies / products are doing and see what works for them and what doesn't work. 

	- Also excelling past their standards and building your own.


- Card Sorting

	- Create cards (digital or physical) with different aspects and functions of your desgin / product. 

	- Have groups groups setup groups and have the client and other testers organize the cards into where they think they should go / what the fit under. 

	- Make sure the cards are shuffled and they do not contain a pattern that could change the mind of your testers.


- User Persona

	- A collection of information about a person, eg: name, age, location, education, relationship, hobbies, likes / dislikes, etc.

	- Use this to tailor the website to a group of people with similar personas.


- Empathy Map

	- Get a list of feelings and thoughts from the testers and find patterns and common ideas between similar personas.


- Journey Map

	- Create a map of the changes you make and the feedback you receive.


- Site map

	- Create a map of where different buttons and pages / scenes go to for an easy way to see the overall .


- Low Fidelity

	- A very simple mockup of what the design could look like to get feedback from the client that can easily be applied.


- High Fidelity

	- A higher quality layout mockup with more detail.

	- A full mockup of what the product will look like to show the client to get accurate feedback on.


- Build and Test

	- Create a minimal working version of the see if the interaction between the user and the product is as desired of the client.

	- Add or remove any features the client wants.









## UX Summaries

- User Experience Study

	Investigate what your client wants and their thought processes and common thinking patterns -- "put yourself in their shoes". Understand what the client and other similar users. Create a general persona of the users the product is directed towards to make sure you are not trying to cater for too many different personalities and likes and dislikes. Make sure to understand what they want and solely what *they* want, do not influence their choices and decisions with your own ideas and solutions and thoughts.


- User/Stakeholder Questions:

	Ask questions that give a broad idea of the product, then ask more in-depth questions that outline more specific aspects, then ask questions that give you a background of them and their persona, and their desired audience's persona.


- Gut Test

	Get lots of examples from different didgital products and ask the client to rate each example from 1 - 5; 1 meaning terrible and 5 meaning brilliant. Use a collection of at least 5 final designs / products that were rated 4+ to get a good idea of what the client desires. This helps you understand what the client expects and how they want to product to respond and look like.


- Relevant Implications

	Explain how your desgin addresses issues and problems, eg: legal, social, privacy, accessibility, future-proofing. This makes sure that you know what errors could arrise, and how you will fix them.


- Feedback

	Ask the client about the issues and don't suggest a solution. Getting the client's pure and uninfluenced point of view is cruicial to tailoring the design to their wants and needs. Make sure that the desgin you give them is up to a standard where it can be tested / reviewed efficiently with sufficient. This makes it easy to apply changes and tailor your desgin to the client perfectly.


- Competitive Analysis

	- Check what similar companies / products are doing and see what works for them and what doesn't work. Excel past their standards and building your own new project based off of user studies and persona research.


- Card Sorting

	- Create cards (digital or physical) with different aspects and functions of your desgin / product. 

	- Have groups groups setup groups and have the client and other testers organize the cards into where they think they should go / what the fit under. 

	- Make sure the cards are shuffled and they do not contain a pattern that could change the mind of your testers.


- User Persona

	A collection information about a person, eg: name, age, location, education, relationship, hobbies, likes / dislikes, etc, and use this to tailor the website to a group of people with similar personas.


- Empathy Map

	A list of feelings and thoughts from the testers and find patterns and common ideas between similar personas. Use this feedback to change your design and show the evolution of your plan.


- Journey Map

	A map of all the changes you make and the feedback you receive. Show how the desgin changes and what worked and what didn't. It is useful to get an overall view of your plan and see where it is going and find patterns that may have worked or not have worked.


- Site map

	A map of where different buttons and pages / scenes go to for an easy way to see the overall. It creates a simple outline of progression through the product for the client to give feedback on. This makes it very easy to apply changes without having to change the entire desgin.


- Low Fidelity

	A very simple mockup of what the design could look like to get feedback from the client that can easily be applied. This makes it easy to change the desgin without having to spend too much time on rearranging or even completely redesigning.


- High Fidelity

	A higher quality layout mockup with more detail. A full mockup of what the product will look like to show the client to get accurate feedback on.


- Build and Test

	- A minimal working version of the see if the interaction between the user and the product.
