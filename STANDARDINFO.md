## Marking Scheme

| **A** | **M** | **E** |
|---|---|---|
| <br> Apply user experience methodologies to develop a design for a digital technologies outcome. <br> <br> The student has: <br> ● explained the purpose of the outcome and the requirements of the end users <br> The student has chosen a specific context for the digital design outcome such as a website, game, app, film, etc. The student then clearly explains the purpose and end users. <br> <br> ● investigated relevant user experience methodologies <br> The student researches methods or examples of generating design ideas using a range of user experience methodologies that may include: user research, usability evaluation, information architecture, user interface design, interaction design,     visual design, content strategy, accessibility. <br> <br> ● applied user experience methodologies to generate a range of design ideas <br> The student selects and uses appropriate design conventions to generate two or more design ideas for the digital outcome. They have demonstrated the application of user experience methodologies. <br> <br> ● explained the appropriateness of the chosen design <br> The student provides a description of how the design is appropriate to the purpose and end user requirements, such as easy to read, navigate, meets accessibility standards. <br> <br> ● modelled and tested the design idea <br> The student shows evidence of trialing and testing design ideas. This may include: <br> - evidence of discussions with teacher <br> - trialing ideas with end-users such as going through procedures <br> - checking users’ understanding <br> - data gained from modelling and user testing. <br>  <br> ● explained relevant implications <br> Implications explained may include: <br> - aesthetics of the design <br> - functionality <br> - accessibility considerations <br> intellectual property | <br> The student has: <br> ● effectively used data gained from modelling and user testing to improve the design <br> The student shows where feedback/data has been used to improve their design or the design of an interface. This may include: <br> - evidence of teacher feedback on the functionality of the design <br> - further internet research on a specific detail that leads to improved design <br> - data from user testing on the suitability of the features included in the design <br> - explained end-user considerations and how their design meets these. <br> <br> ● evaluated how user experience methodologies were used in developing the chosen design <br> The student has provided an evaluation of the user experience methodologies used in the design and what information these methods could highlight and resolve prior to development of the digital outcome. <br> <br> ● evaluated how the chosen design addressed relevant implications <br> The student has evaluated (given reasons) why their design will enable a fit for purpose digital outcome. They have used evidence to evaluate how their design addresses implications such as ease of use, technical feasibility, functionality, reliability, privacy | <br> The student has: <br> ● justified the choice of user experience methodologies used to develop the chosen design <br> The student shows a clear link between their research and the user experience methodologies used in developing the design and modelling they conducted. The student is able to justify the UX methodology chosen with clear links to their design. <br> <br> ● justified that the chosen design is suitable for the purpose and end users <br> The student is able to justify design decisions around elements selection, for example: <br> - Images, graphics, fonts – legibility, readability <br> - Clarity of instructions and/or features that enhance the intuitiveness of the digital outcome <br> - Display and feedback <br> The student is able to justify how each component, or element of the design will function in a way that enables the digital outcome to work reliably for the end users. <br> <br> ● justified how the chosen design might be further developed in the future <br> The student may look beyond the initial design idea to a next phase of development explaining digital outcome changes that refine the design to enable improved functionality and incorporate other or refined application of user experience methodologies |

## External  

- [ ] What is Big Data 

- [ ] The Characteristics of Big Data - 3 V's 

- [ ] Generation, bias and storage 

## Project Management 

- [ ] Waterfall - what is it with a diagram and the pros and cons 

- [ ] Scrum - what is it  with a diagram  and the pros and cons 

- [ ] Add experts opinions throughout 

- [ ] Compare both methods and say which you are using and why - House of Cards 

- [ ] Planning tools - analyze various tools, to do lists, Gantt charts, scrum boards and say which you are using a why 

- [ ] Decompose your project (to do list, brainstorm etc) This is everything you need to do. Look at your previous web projects. 

- [ ] Break into Sprints (We are following the scrum process) - what are you going to do in each sprint. Estimate the time frame for each. How long for each sprint? Think about the approx. dates. Think about the length of time to get feedback etc and factor this in. Will you work at weekends? What resources will you need? Any constraints in the physical or social environment in which the website/ app will be developed? Look at the standards.  

- [ ] Create your Gantt chart V1 using your preferred tool (meetings with client, trialing and testing) 

- [ ] Add review points 

- [ ] Add critical review points 

- [ ] Set up your scrum board for your first Sprint using your preferred tool
